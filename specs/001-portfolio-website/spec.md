Out of scope: comment systems, login, database, or third-party analytics beyond basic tracking."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Portfolio Visitor First Impression (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

A recruiter or hiring manager lands on the portfolio to evaluate the candidate's professional profile and recent work.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary user journey. Without a compelling first impression (Home/About + Projects), the portfolio fails its core purpose. This story delivers immediate value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the homepage, viewing profile information (name, title, photo, social links), scrolling to projects section, and clicking through to project details. Delivers standalone value even without Experience or Contact sections.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor arrives at the homepage, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see profile photo, name, professional title (Data Scientist / ML Engineer), a 2-3 sentence introduction, and social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email) within 2 seconds
2. **Given** the visitor scrolls down, **When** they reach the Projects section, **Then** they see 4-6 project cards displayed in a grid with project title, 1-2 sentence summary, tech stack badges, and links to repo/demo
3. **Given** the visitor is on mobile (320px-768px), **When** they view the site, **Then** the layout adapts to single-column, touch targets are â‰¥44px, and all content remains accessible
4. **Given** the visitor uses a screen reader, **When** they navigate the page, **Then** all images have alt text, headings follow semantic hierarchy (h1â†’h2â†’h3), and interactive elements are keyboard accessible
5. **Given** the visitor clicks a social link icon, **When** the link is activated, **Then** it opens GitHub/LinkedIn in a new tab or triggers email client with proper mailto: link

### User Story 2 - Experience & Resume Access (Priority: P2)

A visitor wants to review professional experience details and download the resume for offline review or ATS submission.

**Why this priority**: Experience and resume access are critical for job applications but secondary to initial impression. This story adds depth to the candidate's profile.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to Experience section (or scrolling from homepage), viewing Foxconn and Wistron role details with metrics, then accessing Contact/Resume section to download PDF resume. Functions independently of Projects section.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor scrolls to the Experience section, **When** they view role entries, **Then** they see company name, role title, date range, 2-4 bullet points highlighting achievements with quantifiable metrics (e.g., "Improved model accuracy by 15%")
2. **Given** the visitor navigates to Contact/Resume section, **When** they click the "Download Resume" button, **Then** a PDF file downloads with filename format `FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf`
3. **Given** the visitor is reviewing experience on mobile, **When** they scroll through entries, **Then** text remains readable (â‰¥16px), line height â‰¥1.5, and no horizontal scrolling occurs
4. **Given** the visitor uses keyboard navigation, **When** they tab through Experience entries, **Then** focus states are visible and they can activate download button via Enter/Space key

### User Story 3 - Optional Blog Content Consumption (Priority: P3)

A visitor wants to read blog posts or technical articles to assess the candidate's communication skills and domain expertise.

**Why this priority**: Blog is explicitly optional. While it adds depth and demonstrates thought leadership, it's not essential for the portfolio's primary function (showcasing work and enabling contact).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to Blog section (if present), viewing list of markdown posts with titles and dates, clicking through to read full post content. Fully functional even if Projects/Experience are minimal.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor navigates to the Blog section, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a list of blog posts with title, publication date, 1-2 sentence excerpt, and estimated read time
2. **Given** the visitor clicks a blog post title, **When** the post page loads, **Then** they see the full markdown-rendered content with proper typography (headings, lists, code blocks with syntax highlighting)
3. **Given** the visitor is reading a blog post, **When** they scroll, **Then** line length is constrained to 60-75 characters for readability, images are lazy-loaded, and code blocks have copy buttons
4. **Given** the visitor finishes reading, **When** they reach the end of the post, **Then** they see a "Back to Blog" link and optional related posts (if multiple posts exist)

---

### User Story 4 - Contact Form Submission (Priority: P2)

A visitor wants to send a direct message without leaving the website or opening their email client.

**Why this priority**: Contact form is a secondary method (email link is primary via social icons). This story improves user experience but isn't blocking for basic contact capability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to Contact section, filling out form fields (name, email, message), submitting, and receiving confirmation. Functions independently without requiring other sections.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor navigates to the Contact section, **When** they view the form, **Then** they see input fields for Name (required), Email (required), Message (required, textarea), and a Submit button
2. **Given** the visitor fills out the form with valid data, **When** they click Submit, **Then** the form sends an email (via static form service like Formspree or Netlify Forms) and displays a success message "Thank you! I'll get back to you soon."
3. **Given** the visitor submits the form with missing/invalid data, **When** validation runs, **Then** they see inline error messages (e.g., "Email is required", "Please enter a valid email")
4. **Given** the visitor is on mobile, **When** they interact with form fields, **Then** input types trigger appropriate keyboards (email input shows @ key), touch targets are â‰¥44px, and labels are clearly associated with inputs

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a project has no live demo link (only repo)? â†’ Show only repo link, hide/disable demo button
- What happens when the blog section has zero posts? â†’ Show "Coming soon" message or hide blog navigation link entirely
- How does the site handle extremely long project descriptions? â†’ Truncate summaries to 2 sentences max, expand on dedicated project detail page (out of scope for MVP, truncate for now)
- What happens when visitor has JavaScript disabled? â†’ Core content (text, images, links) remains accessible; form may fall back to native HTML5 validation or external form service
- How does the site handle slow network connections? â†’ Critical CSS inlined, images lazy-loaded, font subsetting, target <2s load on 3G
- What happens when resume PDF is not available? â†’ Hide download button or show "Resume available upon request" message
