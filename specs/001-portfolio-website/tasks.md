# Tasks: Personal Portfolio Website

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-portfolio-website/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT requested in this specification. Tasks focus on implementation only.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- All paths relative to `/Users/shan5433/Desktop/portfolio/portfolio-web/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 but typically follows for logical flow
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 and US2
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Fully optional, independent of all other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Data files before components that consume them
- Section components before page composition
- Core implementation before animations and polish
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 1: T003-T008 (all dependency installations) can run in parallel
- Phase 1: T010-T014 (all configuration files) can run in parallel
- Phase 1: T020-T022 (all directory creation) can run in parallel
- Phase 2: T024-T025, T027 (hooks), T029-T031, T033, T035-T036 (components) can run in parallel
- Phase 3: T038-T042 (all sample project data files) can run in parallel
- Phase 6: T081-T082 (blog post data files) can run in parallel
- Phase 7: T098-T100 (placeholder images), T102-T103, T105-T106, T108-T109, T113-T114 can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members after Phase 2 completes

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Setup

```bash
# Launch all project data files together:
Task: "Create src/data/profile.json with placeholder profile data"
Task: "Create src/data/projects/sample-project-1.md"
Task: "Create src/data/projects/sample-project-2.md"
Task: "Create src/data/projects/sample-project-3.md"
Task: "Create src/data/projects/sample-project-4.md"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T022)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T023-T037) - CRITICAL, blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T038-T055)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test homepage with profile and projects
5. Add minimal polish tasks from Phase 7 (images, build, deploy)
6. Deploy MVP

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 4 (Contact Form) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
4. Add User Story 2 (Experience & Resume) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
5. Add User Story 3 (Blog) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (Full site!)
6. Complete Polish phase ‚Üí Final optimizations ‚Üí Deploy production

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Homepage + Projects)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Experience + Resume)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (Contact Form)
   - Developer D: User Story 3 (Blog) - lowest priority
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Total tasks: 123
- MVP scope: Phases 1-3 (T001-T055) = 55 tasks
- Full feature scope: Phases 1-7 (all 123 tasks)
