## Overview

Created a complete portfolio website without writing code manually. Used SpecKit workflow with Claude Code to generate specifications, implement features, and deploy to GitHub Pages automatically.

## AI-Driven Development Workflow

### 1. Specification Phase
- Used `/speckit.specify` to create detailed feature specifications
- Defined requirements: sections (Hero, Projects, Experience, Contact), tech stack, design system
- Claude generated comprehensive spec with data models and component contracts

### 2. Implementation Phase
- Ran `/speckit.implement` to auto-generate entire codebase
- Claude built React components, routing, styling, and utilities
- Personalized content by providing name, email, GitHub, LinkedIn, resume
- Claude integrated my real work experience (Foxconn, Wistron)

### 3. Deployment Phase
- Claude created GitHub Actions workflow automatically
- Fixed deployment issues through interactive problem-solving
- Removed environment protection blocking deployment
- Site went live at https://5433shan.github.io/portfolio-web/

## What Claude Code Generated

- Complete React 18 + Vite 5 project structure
- Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- 4 sections: Hero, Projects, Experience, Contact
- Resume download integration
- Contact form with validation
- GitHub Pages deployment pipeline
- Responsive design with accessibility support

## Key Advantages

**Zero Manual Coding**: Claude wrote 100% of the code based on specifications
**Fast Iteration**: Fixed bugs and added features through conversation
**Professional Quality**: Production-ready code with best practices
**Full Deployment**: Automated CI/CD pipeline included

## Outcome

A fully functional, production-ready portfolio website created entirely through AI assistance. Demonstrates how modern AI tools can handle complete software projects from specification to deployment without traditional programming.
